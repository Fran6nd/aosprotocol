This page documents the networking Protocol of Ace of Spades 0.75, as well as
the extensions made by the community.

# Overview
[Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com/) uses the [ENet networking
library](http://sauerbraten.org/enet/) for all server-client
communication. The initial source for the protocol information was the original
[pyspades](http://code.google.com/p/pyspades/) source code, for which the
source for 1.0 was not released. Nonetheless, the 1.0 alpha client has been
reverse engineered to document the protocol.

## Versions

 * [0.75 (and 0.76) documentation](protocol075.md)
 * [1.0 alpha documentation](protocol100a1.md)

## Extensions

The 0.75 protocol supports extensions, which allow adding new packets as well as
querying the support for client and server functionality.

The ids, types and negotiation mechanism are described in
[Extensions](extensions/extension.md). The registry of extension ids, each
with a link to its specification, is listed in the
[0.75 documentation](protocol075.md#extensions).
