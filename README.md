# aosprotocol
Documentation and development of the protocol used primarily by Voxlap (classic) v0.75/v0.76, OpenSpades, BetterSpades, pyspades, PySnip and piqueserver.

This started out as a dump of the aoswiki.rakiru.com Protocol page, but is meant to be the hub for
developing the AoS protocol in the future.

Browse the documentation at https://www.piqueserver.org/aosprotocol, or just read through the git repository instead.

## Implementations
